## Rock, Paper, Scissor, Spock, Lizard

Rock, Paper and Scissor has always been a fun game to play.
</br>
Rock, Paper, Scissor, Spock and Lizard is the advanced version of the game. It is even more fun to play. Here I have designed the game to be played between a user and the computer. It is an interactive game with normal and advanced version. There is a score box in which the user's score is displayed.
